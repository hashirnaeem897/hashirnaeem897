# 💫 About Me:
I've been a professional developer at established software companies for the past 5 years, using languages like JavaScript, PHP, Flutter, and accompanying technologies like Node.js, MySQL, and Laravel. Presently I am most interested in working on small-to-large projects that solve an existing problem in your business, but I'm open to longer-term or more speculative projects as well.
